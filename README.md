# py_utils - WORK IN PROGRESS

Py_utils is a very small set of Python-native implementations for Python standard library. These implementations should give you some insight into how some Python's built-ins may behave.

In future, it will aim for improved unit tests and vice versa.

Any suggestions or algorithmicalgorithmicalgorithmic improvements will be much appreciated.
