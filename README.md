# py_utils - WORK IN PROGRESS and FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES

Py_utils is a very small set of Python-native implementations for Python standard library. These implementations should give you some insight into how some Python's built-ins may behave.

In future, it will aim for improved unit tests and vice versa.

Any suggestions or algorithmic improvements will be much appreciated.

Ready to use:

`utils.Map`

`utils.deep_update`

`utils.export_json # format a dict into json-readable data`

For ready-to-use functions - the examples and docs can be found in `/examples` folder.

All the namespaces starting with an underscore are experimental.
